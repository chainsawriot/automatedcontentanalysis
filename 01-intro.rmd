# Introduction {#intro}

When I was a high-school student, biology was my favourite subject. My bigger brother used the same textbook but an outdated edition and thus I didn't need to buy it. Meanwhile my classmates were using the newer edition, I enjoyed reading the old edition from my brother. That book had over 1000 pages and was completely in black and white. Students and teachers alike spotted me reading that book almost all the time at the corner of the spectator stand.
