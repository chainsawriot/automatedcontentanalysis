# Introduction {#intro}

When I was a high-school student, biology was my favourite subject. My bigger brother used the same textbook but an outdated edition and thus I didn't need to buy one. My classmates were using the newer edition, but I enjoyed reading the old edition from my brother. That book had over 1,000 pages and was completely in black and white. Students and teachers alike spotted me reading that book almost all the time at the corner of the spectator stand.

Why do I need to bring this little irrelevant story up? Francis Crick, James Watson and the oft-ignored female post-graduate student Rosalind Franklin discovered the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953. By the time I was reading the biology textbook printed in the early 90s, it was almost 40 years ago. The biology textbook of the period had an introduction to the double helix structure of DNA, as you can imagine,  in a boring way. I would say the discover of the double helix structure is probably one of the most important discovery in science, the textbook of the period did not describe it as a "hype". Instead, it was described as if it was as boring as counting sheep. When something was written in the textbook, it is instantly becoming uncool.

But still, why do I need to bring this little irrelevant story up? Some would dispute this, but the world first automated content analysis system is probably the General Inquirer system. The original paper about the system was published in 1962 by the late Philip J. Stone and his colleagues at the Harvard Laboratory of Social Relations. The General Inquirer (GI) uses a method --- that is called "dictionary-based method" now --- to quantify the characteristics of a piece of text.

At the time of my writing, it is 2020 now. The world first automayed content analysis was 58 years old. If there is still an innovative factor of using a 58-year old technology and hype about it, it is actually a bit absurd. Although mew dictionaries are developed almost very month, many communication researchers --- myself included --- are doing automated content analysis the way very similar to Philip J. Stone and Co. did back in 1962. The discouse about automated content analysis should be very similar to way I read about the double helix structure when I was a high-school student in the mid 90s: it should be boring and uncool.
