Make Automated Content Analysis uncool again\! No more hype\!

Coming soon\!

# Introduction

When I was a high-school student, biology was my favourite subject. My
bigger brother used the same textbook in a outline edition and thus I
didn’t need to buy it. Meanwhile my classmates were using the newer
edition, I enjoyed reading the old edition from my brother. That book
had over 1000 pages and was completely in black and white. Students and
teachers alike spotted me reading that book almost all the time at the
corner of the spectator stand.

# A Whole game

We are going to use an example to illustrate the whole process of a
typical automated content analysis scenario. In this example, we start
with a simple research question or hypothesis. Let’s say I want to
reproduce a very famous analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets. This example
is very well-known in the data science scene, probably because one of
the authors of the tidytext package used this example to demonstrate the
power of his package (and made him on the television). The research
question is very simple: are tweets from Donald Trump’s twitter account
tweeted using an iPhone less angry than those tweeted using an Android
phone?
