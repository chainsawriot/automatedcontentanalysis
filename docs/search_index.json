["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction When I was a high-school student, biology was my favourite subject. Of course, I need to have the biology textbook to study and my school had assigned me to buy one. My older brother are 7 years older than me and he had the same textbook but an outdated edition. Hence, I didn’t need to buy one, I just used his book. My classmates were using the newer edition, but I enjoyed reading the old edition from my brother. That book had over 1,000 pages and was completely in black and white. Students and teachers alike spotted me reading that book almost all the time at the corner of the spectator stand. At the time of my graduation, that 1,000-page book was broken into multiple ‘volumes’, due to my very frequent reading. Why do I need to bring this little irrelevant story up? Francis Crick, James Watson and the oft-ignored female post-graduate student Rosalind Franklin discovered the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953. By the time I was reading the biology textbook printed in the early 90s, it was almost 40 years ago. The biology textbook of the period had an introduction to the double helix structure of DNA, as you can imagine, in a boring way. I would say the discovery of the double helix structure is probably one of the most important discovery in science, the textbook of the period did not describe it as a “hype”. Instead, it was described as if it was as boring as counting sheep. When something was written in the textbook, that something is instantly became uncool. But still, why do I need to bring this little irrelevant story up? Some would dispute this, but the world first automated content analysis system is probably the General Inquirer system. The original paper about the system was published in 1962 by the late Philip J. Stone and his colleagues at the Harvard Laboratory of Social Relations. The General Inquirer (GI) uses a method—that is called “dictionary-based method” now—to quantify the characteristics of a piece of text. At the time of writing, it is 2020 now. The world first automated content analysis was 58 years old. If there is still an innovation factor of using a 58-year old technology and hype about it, it is actually absurd. Although mew dictionaries are developed almost every month, many communication researchers—myself included—are doing automated content analysis the way very similar to Philip J. Stone and Co. did back in 1962. The discouse about automated content analysis should be very similar to way I read about the double helix structure when I was a high-school student in the mid 90s: it should be boring and uncool. The motto of this book is simple: Making automated content analysis uncool again. I must admit that I stole this motto from another project: The folks at fast.ai have used the motto “Making neural nets uncool again” since the website’s inception. The founders of the MOOC site feel that the hype around deep learning or artificial intelligence is very unhealthy. They says in their mission statement that being cool is about being exclusive. They want to make deep learning as accessible as possible —including those using uncool operating systems like Windows and with uncool backgrounds (e.g. those did not go to Stanford). As a person using an uncool text editor —emacs, a now 44-year-old technology— to write this book, I agree with their vision. I want to make automated content analysis as accessible as possible so that there is no more hype around it. Everyone can do it and everyone can then do it correctly. As everyone, cool and uncool people included, can do automated content analysis by reading this open access book, we should ask more important questions such as: Are we doing automated content analysis in a way that has adequate validity and reliability? I hope you will enjoy reading this book. "],

This is called the “Play the Whole Game” approach by Perkins (2010).1 In this example, we start with a simple research question or hypothesis. Let’s say I want to reproduce a very famous analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets. This example is very well-known in the data science world, probably because David Robinsom (one of the authors of the tidytext package) used this example to demonstrate the power of his package (and made him on the television). The research question is very simple: are tweets from Donald Trump’s twitter account tweeted using an iPhone more positive than those tweeted using an Android phone? There are many elements to unpack from the above paragraph, but the above paragraph illustrates how data scientists and automated content analysis practitioners approach the problem differently. The utmost important element is: All automated content analysis project must have hypotheses to test or research questions to answer. If a project without hypotheses or research questions, it can hardly be called automated content analysis (see Chapter 2 for longer discussion). We also need to specify the context we are interested in analyzing (Donald Trump and his Twitter). Later on, we need to think about the operationalization of variables (what is positive?), data collection plan and data analysis strategy. In this book, however, we are not going to focus on 1) how to form hypotheses or research questions and 2) how to collect your (text) data. The reason for excluding the former is simple: It needs to be supported by communication theories. As a book that is intented as an research methods book, it is probably a bit too much to ask.2 For the latter, the exclusion of it is due to the fact that there are good papers and textbooks available. The book chapter by Liang and Zhu (2017) is probably a good start. Munzert et al. (2014) ’s Automated Data Collection with R is an in-depth manual. At this point, you should probably go to preregister the hypotheses of this automated content analysis project. And then you should study the rtweet package by the wonderful Michael Kearney. Let’s suppose your data is now magically available. In the companion website of this book, you can find the data file with tweets from Donald Trump’s tweet account before he assumes duty as the president of the United States. The data looks like this: require(tidyverse) ## Loading required package: tidyverse ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.3.3 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() require(quanteda) ## Loading required package: quanteda ## Package version: 1.9.9009 ## Parallel computing: 2 of 4 threads used. ## See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples. ## ## Attaching package: &#39;quanteda&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:utils&#39;: ## ## View require(rio) ## Loading required package: rio ## ## Attaching package: &#39;rio&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:quanteda&#39;: ## ## convert trump_tweets &lt;- import(&#39;./data/trump.json&#39;) %&gt;% as_tibble trump_tweets ## # A tibble: 17,936 x 7 ## source text created_at retweet_count favorite_count is_retweet id_str ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Twitte… Heads of … Mon Dec 31… 20519 74566 FALSE 10798… ## 2 Twitte… ....Senat… Mon Dec 31… 17027 63013 FALSE 10798… ## 3 Twitte… It’s incr… Mon Dec 31… 29355 125931 FALSE 10797… ## 4 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 30742 131151 FALSE 10797… ## 5 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 1123 4217 FALSE 10797… ## 6 Twitte… I am the … Mon Dec 31… 25252 111582 FALSE 10797… ## 7 Twitte… I campaig… Mon Dec 31… 21960 90883 FALSE 10797… ## 8 Twitte… .....Exce… Mon Dec 31… 15081 72353 FALSE 10797… ## 9 Twitte… ...I camp… Mon Dec 31… 22000 100819 FALSE 10797… ## 10 Twitte… If anybod… Mon Dec 31… 17379 79095 FALSE 10797… ## # … with 17,926 more rows Up to this point, you might notice this book uses tidyverse—or more precisely, dplyr—for data manipulation. Yes. If you are not familar with dplyr, it is a good idea for you to read the book R4DS (available online). The book you are reading now is not an introduction to dplyr. But as a refresher, let me show you all the dplyr you will need to deal with 80% of the situations. You probably only need to know 5 verbs and then combine them together. You may call these 6 verbs “Big Six” if you like. 3.2 An express summary of tidyverse The first verb is select. It is used to select particular column(s) from a data frame. By the way, our data is a tibble, an arguably nicer version of data frame. Suppose we want to select only the columns source and text. trump_tweets %&gt;% select(source, text) ## # A tibble: 17,936 x 2 ## source text ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Twitter for iPh… Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator … ## 2 Twitter for iPh… ....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other… ## 3 Twitter for iPh… It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous … ## 4 Twitter for iPh… I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation … ## 5 Twitter for iPh… I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation … ## 6 Twitter for iPh… I am the only person in America who could say that, “I’m br… ## 7 Twitter for iPh… I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have with… ## 8 Twitter for iPh… .....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said the… ## 9 Twitter for iPh… ...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. N… ## 10 Twitter for iPh… If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which … ## # … with 17,926 more rows The second verb is filter. It is used to filter rows from a tibble based on certain criteria. Suppose you want to get all the rows which were tweeted from an Android phone. trump_tweets %&gt;% filter(str_detect(source, &quot;Android&quot;)) %&gt;% select(source, text) ## # A tibble: 7,302 x 2 ## source text ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Twitter for And… &quot;Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M.&quot; ## 2 Twitter for And… &quot;ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and pi… ## 3 Twitter for And… &quot;LinkedIn Workforce Report: January and February were the s… ## 4 Twitter for And… &quot;Don&#39;t let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infight… ## 5 Twitter for And… &quot;I am working on a new system where there will be competiti… ## 6 Twitter for And… &quot;Don&#39;t worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promot… ## 7 Twitter for And… &quot;For eight years Russia \\&quot;ran over\\&quot; President Obama, got s… ## 8 Twitter for And… &quot;Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review an… ## 9 Twitter for And… &quot;122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administratio… ## 10 Twitter for And… &quot;Who was it that secretly said to Russian President, \\&quot;Tell… ## # … with 7,292 more rows In the above example, we combine two verbs (filter and select) using the pipe (%&gt;%) operator. Some might disagree, but this method is more elegant. If you can tell a story using your dplyr code, it is probably a good code. For example, you can tell a story using the above code as such: We have our trump_tweets data, and then we filter all tweets where source contains “Android”, and then we select only the source and text columns. So, the pipe operators in the above code are corresponding to all “and then” in the story. From the above story, you might notice that the source column is recording from which device the tweet was tweeted, e.g. Android. It is a good idea to see what are the other variants of “source” in our data. The next verb that we need to know is group_by. trump_tweets %&gt;% group_by(source) ## # A tibble: 17,936 x 7 ## # Groups: source [16] ## source text created_at retweet_count favorite_count is_retweet id_str ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Twitte… Heads of … Mon Dec 31… 20519 74566 FALSE 10798… ## 2 Twitte… ....Senat… Mon Dec 31… 17027 63013 FALSE 10798… ## 3 Twitte… It’s incr… Mon Dec 31… 29355 125931 FALSE 10797… ## 4 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 30742 131151 FALSE 10797… ## 5 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 1123 4217 FALSE 10797… ## 6 Twitte… I am the … Mon Dec 31… 25252 111582 FALSE 10797… ## 7 Twitte… I campaig… Mon Dec 31… 21960 90883 FALSE 10797… ## 8 Twitte… .....Exce… Mon Dec 31… 15081 72353 FALSE 10797… ## 9 Twitte… ...I camp… Mon Dec 31… 22000 100819 FALSE 10797… ## 10 Twitte… If anybod… Mon Dec 31… 17379 79095 FALSE 10797… ## # … with 17,926 more rows It seems that we have done nothing here. But you might notice the output says “Groups: source [16]”. group_by works the best when it is combined with summarise. dplyr is smart enough to accept both British and American spellings. So you can use summarize if you want.3 We use summarise to generate one-element summary of your data. For example, you want to get the total number of rows of this data. trump_tweets %&gt;% summarise(ntweets = n()) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## ntweets ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 17936 Using the above code, we can tell a story as such: We have our trump_tweets data, and then we want to summarise our data as ntweets whereas ntweets equals to n(), i.e. number of rows. Let’s try to use this verb with group_by: trump_tweets %&gt;% group_by(source) %&gt;% summarise(ntweets = n()) ## # A tibble: 16 x 2 ## source ntweets ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Facebook 2 ## 2 Instagram 70 ## 3 Media Studio 156 ## 4 Mobile Web (M5) 2 ## 5 Neatly For BlackBerry 10 5 ## 6 Periscope 7 ## 7 TweetDeck 2 ## 8 Twitter Ads 97 ## 9 Twitter for Android 7302 ## 10 Twitter for BlackBerry 94 ## 11 Twitter for iPad 59 ## 12 Twitter for iPhone 7965 ## 13 Twitter Media Studio 12 ## 14 Twitter Mirror for iPad 1 ## 15 Twitter QandA 10 ## 16 Twitter Web Client 2152 The story of the above code is: We have our trump_tweets … probably I can skip this part now, and then we group our data by source and then we summarise our data as ntweets whereas ntweets equals to n(), i.e. number of rows. So, what group_by does, is to split the data into groups by a certain column (or columns). The subsequent steps are then became group-based analysis. This principle is called “Split-Apply-Combine strategy” by Wickham (2011). this group-based analysis shows that there are many variants! In this analysis, we keep only those tweets from iPhone and Android only. So, which verb we should use? I give you 10 seconds to think. Well… trump_tweets %&gt;% filter(str_detect(source, &quot;Android|iPhone&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 15,267 x 7 ## source text created_at retweet_count favorite_count is_retweet id_str ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Twitte… Heads of … Mon Dec 31… 20519 74566 FALSE 10798… ## 2 Twitte… ....Senat… Mon Dec 31… 17027 63013 FALSE 10798… ## 3 Twitte… It’s incr… Mon Dec 31… 29355 125931 FALSE 10797… ## 4 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 30742 131151 FALSE 10797… ## 5 Twitte… I’m in th… Mon Dec 31… 1123 4217 FALSE 10797… ## 6 Twitte… I am the … Mon Dec 31… 25252 111582 FALSE 10797… ## 7 Twitte… I campaig… Mon Dec 31… 21960 90883 FALSE 10797… ## 8 Twitte… .....Exce… Mon Dec 31… 15081 72353 FALSE 10797… ## 9 Twitte… ...I camp… Mon Dec 31… 22000 100819 FALSE 10797… ## 10 Twitte… If anybod… Mon Dec 31… 17379 79095 FALSE 10797… ## # … with 15,257 more rows mutate is for creating new columns. trump_tweets %&gt;% filter(str_detect(source, &quot;Android|iPhone&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(android = str_detect(source, &quot;Android&quot;)) %&gt;% select(android, text) ## # A tibble: 15,267 x 2 ## android text ## &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 FALSE Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer i… ## 2 FALSE ....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administ… ## 3 FALSE It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bit… ## 4 FALSE I’m in the Oval Office.

We have our data! So we should do our sentiment analysis now, right? NO! Nein! Non! いいえ! 唔係! 3.3 Creating ground truth data This is another split-path between data scientists and automated content analysts. If you know nothing about automated content analysis, the traditional way of dealing with our data is to manually code all tweets. The word “code” as a verb can create confusion here, because it can also mean “programming.”4 In this programming-heavy book, I am going to use another verb for “coding” (in the social sciences’ sense): data categorizing. I believe this term can still capture most, but not all, nuances of the verb “coding” (in the social sciences’ sense). For the verb “coding” in the programming’s sense, I am going to use, as you can guess, programming. Sorry for the detour. Traditionally, social scientists approach this problem by catagorizing the unstructured data into a form suitable for computer analysis. A tweet is a bunch of characters that a (naive) computer cannot extract meanings—or semantics—out of it. However, whether or not a tweet is positive is a semantic problem. Homo sapiens have a brain and some of us have the knowledge in English to determine the semantics of a piece of text. We need to tell the computer, what semantically is expressed in a tweet. This procedure is called data categorization. In an academic setting, it usually means the principal investigator of this project (i.e. you) would assemble a team of student assistants to categorize all tweets by reading them one by one and then asserting every one of them if they are positive or not. In order to ensure interrater reliability, we usually assign at least two student assistants to read one tweet. This procedure of data categorization is notoriously expensive. In Germany, for instance, one needs to pay a student assistant €15.8 per hour in 2020. Let’s assume a student assistant can read 4 tweets per minute. In order to read every single tweets (n = 15,267) by two students, it takes (15,267 x 2) / 4 = 7,633.5 man-minutes or 127.2 man-hours. Therefore, the principal investigator (i.e you) needs to pay €2009.76 just for the data categorization. It is not a handsome amount of money: You can buy 4464 packs of instant ramen that you can eat for about a year. But remember, now you are not doing this for your PhD thesis. It is just an exercise of a stupid book. If you are willing to pay this: “Danke schön!”, your student assistants say. If you are not willing to pay this, what should you do? Instead of asking your student assistants to categorize all data, we can use a computer to categorize the data. But as I said previously, a (naive) computer cannot extract semantics from a piece of text. However, it can extract an approximated version of semantics —or a surrogate measure— from text content. So, what is a surrogate surrogate? The dictionary by Upton and Cook (2014) gives this definition: “A variable that can be measured (or is easy to measure) that is used in place of one that cannot be measured (or is difficult to measure)”. A very similar term is “proxy measure” but there is one crucial difference: Proxy measure is a variable that is used in place of one that cannot be measure. Period. There is no “or” after it. As indicated previously, we can measure the negativity or a tweet by manual data categorization, it is just “diffuclt to measure” due to the cost. Thus, we use a surrogate measure instead. A good surrogate measure should have a strong correlation with the original variable. For example, it is difficult to assess the wealth of a family. It is just difficult, not impossible. As a surrogate measure, we can use the value of the family’s house as an approximation. We know that in normal circumstances, the two variables (the wealth of the family and the value of the family’s house) should be correlated. But for this correlation to be valid, there are many assumptions: people can actually afford a house, rich people buy expensive houses and the housing market is not regulated, just to name three. A surrogate measure is good only when the domain of the measurement can hold the assumptions that maintain the correlation between the surrogate measure and the actual measure. We will come back to this point in Chapter 4. We —as a practitioner of automated content analysis— cannot blindly accept a surrogate measure is always good. It is related to the fact that we are doing automated content analysis, which is actually a content analysis. In the next chapter, we will come back to the validity requirement of any content analysis, automated or not. Up to this point, we have a dilemma: Manual data categorization is too expensive but automated content analysis is just a surrogate measure. What should we do? A simple solution is to test whether the domain of our measurement fits the original assumptions. Therefore, we need to test the correlation between the approximated semantics extracted by the computer and the semantics extracted by humans. As said before, a good surrogate measure should have a strong correlation with the original measurement. For this, we do not need to manually categorize a lot of tweets. A randomly selected handful of tweets will do. We have a name for these manually categorized data for testing the validity of a tool: ground truth data. We will talk more on how to create ground truth data in Chapter 4. As an excercise of creating ground truth data, let’s say we want to create a set of ground truth data with a random sample of 30 tweets. It can be done easily with: set.seed(42) trump_tweets %&gt;% sample_n(30) %&gt;% select(text) %&gt;% rio::export(&#39;data/trump_tweet30.rds&#39;) And then, I ask my team of two student assistants to manually categorize these 30 tweets. This task should take (30 x 2) / 4 = 15 man-minutes. The cost of it (€3.95) is only a few packs of instant ramen. Or, if you are middle class and don’t mind damaging the environment, it is the cost of a “coffee to go”. The coding procedure is simple, or even simplified. The two student assistants categorize the 30 tweets into a category of whether or not the tweet is negative with a 5-point likert scale, i.e. Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state.

In the next section, we will use these ground truth data to validate the automatically extracted semantics from Trump’s tweets. 3.4 Automated sentiment analysis: AFINN Now, with the ground truth data, we can finally do the so called ‘sentiment analysis’. Before, we really do it, I would like to remind you for one last time that the semantics extracted by these method are an approximated version of the true semantics. Thus, it is a surrogate at best. The simpliest method for doing a sentiment analysis is using a dictionary-based method. These methods are explained in Chapter 6. In short, these methods rely on two simple assumptions to calculate the overall sentiment of a piece of text. A dictionary is a collection of words. For example, a negative dictionary might have words that contain negative meanings, for example, f… fool, f… foolish, or f… faulty. A positive dictionary might have words such as good, nice, wonderful. A piece of text with a lot of words in the negative dictionary should have a higher negativity. There are many of these dictionaries available. These readily available dictionaries are called off-the-shelf dictionaries. In Chapter 6, we will discuss the problems of using them. But one way to avoid those problems is to first create ground truth data and validate these dictionaries before use. Another way to avoid those problems is a to use a theory-informed dictionary. We will also talk about how to choose a dictionary in Chapter 6. Here, we are going to use the AFINN dictionary (Nielsen 2011). It is a dictionary designed for measuring sentiment of microblog data, e.g. tweets. afinn &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/afinn.RDS&quot;) afinn ## Dictionary object with 11 key entries. ## - [neg5]: ## - bastard, bastards, bitch, bitches, cock, cocksucker, cocksuckers, cunt, motherfucker, motherfucking, niggas, nigger, prick, slut, son-of-a-bitch, twat ## - [neg4]: ## - ass, assfucking, asshole, bullshit, catastrophic, damn, damned, damnit, dick, dickhead, fraud, frauds, fraudster, fraudsters, fraudulence, fraudulent, fuck, fucked, fucker, fuckers [ ... and 23 more ] ## - [neg3]: ## - abhor, abhorred, abhorrent, abhors, abuse, abused, abuses, abusive, acrimonious, agonise, agonised, agonises, agonising, agonize, agonized, agonizes, agonizing, anger, angers, angry [ ... and 244 more ] ## - [neg2]: ## - abandon, abandoned, abandons, abducted, abduction, abductions, accident, accidental, accidentally, accidents, accusation, accusations, accuse, accused, accuses, accusing, ache, aching, admonish, admonished [ ... and 945 more ] ## - [neg1]: ## - absentee, absentees, admit, admits, admitted, affected, afflicted, affronted, alas, alert, ambivalent, anti, apologise, apologised, apologises, apologising, apologize, apologized, apologizes, apologizing [ ... and 289 more ] ## - [zero]: ## - some kind ## [ reached max_nkey ... 5 more keys ] Sorry for the strong language. AFINN contains categories of words sorted by valence values from -5 (neg5) to +5 (pos5). For example, the word ‘bastard’ is -5 in terms of valence value. According to original paper of AFINN (Nielsen 2011), the AFINN sentiment score of a tweet is calculated as the total valence values of matching words divided by the total number of words. For example, the AFINN sentiment score of the tweet “He is a bastard” is -5 / 4 = 1.25. The total valence values of matching words is 5 because there is only one matching word (bastard) and its valence value is -5. In total, this tweet has 4 words. The following program calculates the correponding AFINN score of each tweet using the R package quanteda (Benoit et al. 2018). In short, this program creates a document-feature matrix (DFM) using Trump’s tweets and then look up this DFM by the AFINN dictionary to seek for matching words. And then, we convert this DFM into a data frame and then do our dplyr magic to calculate the AFINN sentiment score. It might look a bit scary and don’t worry, we will walk through this program again step-by-step in Chapter 6. dfm(trump_tweet30_coded$text, remove_punct = TRUE) %&gt;% dfm_lookup(afinn) %&gt;% quanteda::convert(to = &quot;data.frame&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(matching_word_valence = neg5 * -5 + neg4 * -4 + neg3 * -3 + neg2 * -2 + neg1 * -1 + zero * 0 + pos1 * 1 + pos2 * 2 + pos3 * 3 + pos4 * 4 + pos5 * 5, base = ntoken(trump_tweet30_coded$text, remove_punct = TRUE), afinn_score = matching_word_valence / base) %&gt;% pull(afinn_score) -&gt; afinn_score afinn_score ## text1 text2 text3 text4 text5 text6 ## 0.08695652 0.10000000 0.00000000 0.33333333 0.16666667 0.05882353 ## text7 text8 text9 text10 text11 text12 ## -0.18750000 0.25000000 0.06666667 -0.28571429 0.12500000 0.00000000 ## text13 text14 text15 text16 text17 text18 ## 0.16666667 -0.05000000 0.50000000 0.20000000 0.02173913 0.22727273 ## text19 text20 text21 text22 text23 text24 ## 0.20000000 -0.10638298 0.20000000 -0.08333333 0.04000000 0.18181818 ## text25 text26 text27 text28 text29 text30 ## 0.33333333 0.00000000 0.20000000 -0.04081633 0.36363636 -0.19230769 Once again, this AFINN sentiment score is a surrogate measure of semantics. We can test the correlation between the AFINN score and the results from two human coders. cor.test(trump_tweet30_coded$coder1, afinn_score) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: trump_tweet30_coded$coder1 and afinn_score ## t = 4.6007, df = 28, p-value = 8.258e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.3874427 0.8220729 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6561273 cor.test(trump_tweet30_coded$coder2, afinn_score) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: trump_tweet30_coded$coder2 and afinn_score ## t = 3.3471, df = 28, p-value = 0.00234 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2158833 0.7503365 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5345753 The two correlation coefficients are statistically sigificant. The scatterplot of the two measures is like so: trump_tweet30_coded %&gt;% mutate(afinn_score = afinn_score) %&gt;% mutate(avg_human = (coder1 + coder2) / 2) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = avg_human, y = afinn_score)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) (#fig:corafinn_human)Scatterplot of the correlation between human categorization and AFINN score. It seems that we have evidence to show the AFINN score is a good surrogate measure of sentiment because it has a good correlation with human judgements. Only after this step, we can apply the method to all of the tweets. 3.5 Comparing tweets from Android and iPhone So, we have shown in the previous sections that AFINN score is a good surrogate measure of sentiment. Now, we can calculate the AFINN score of all tweets. trump_tweets %&gt;% filter(str_detect(source, &quot;Android|iPhone&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(android = str_detect(source, &quot;Android&quot;)) %&gt;% select(android, text) -&gt; trump_tweets_target trump_tweets_target ## # A tibble: 15,267 x 2 ## android text ## &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 FALSE Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer i… ## 2 FALSE ....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administ… ## 3 FALSE It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bit… ## 4 FALSE I’m in the Oval Office.

Now when I… ## 10 FALSE If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an IS… ## # … with 15,257 more rows Once again, we use quanteda to calculate the AFINN score. The program below is actually the same as the one above. dfm(trump_tweets_target$text, remove_punct = TRUE) %&gt;% dfm_lookup(afinn) %&gt;% quanteda::convert(to = &quot;data.frame&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(matching_word_valence = neg5 * -5 + neg4 * -4 + neg3 * -3 + neg2 * -2 + neg1 * -1 + zero * 0 + pos1 * 1 + pos2 * 2 + pos3 * 3 + pos4 * 4 + pos5 * 5, base = ntoken(trump_tweets_target$text, remove_punct = TRUE), afinn_score = matching_word_valence / base) %&gt;% pull(afinn_score) -&gt; all_afinn_score So now, we have the information about the device and the AFINN score. tibble(afinn = all_afinn_score, android = trump_tweets_target$android, trump_tweets_target$text) ## # A tibble: 15,267 x 3 ## afinn android `trump_tweets_target$text` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 0.146 FALSE Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator S… ## 2 0 FALSE ....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other … ## 3 -0.0577 FALSE It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous s… ## 4 0.0455 FALSE I’m in the Oval Office.

Please read the previous sentence once again, higher. We can also conduct a test to study the statistical significance of the difference. tibble(afinn = all_afinn_score, android = trump_tweets_target$android) %&gt;% wilcox.test(afinn ~ android, data = .) ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction ## ## data: afinn by android ## W = 28006493, p-value = 7.244e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 It is statistically significant. You can see the distributions of AFINN scores of tweets from an Android and an iPhone with the following histogram. tibble(afinn = all_afinn_score, android = trump_tweets_target$android) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = afinn, fill = android)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) In summary, Trump’s tweets from an Android phone are more positive than those from an iPhone. Therefore, using our automated content analysis approach, we have arrived at a completely different conclusion to David Robinson’s one. In David Robinson’s TV-worthy conclusion, he found that tweets from an Android phone (probably from Trump himshelf) are more negative than tweets from an iPhone (probably from his campaign). Our validated approach arrives at another conclusion: tweets from an Android phone (probably from Trump himshelf) are more positive than tweets from an iPhone. Unlike David Robinson’s “text mining” approach, we have validated our sentiment scores with human. The obvious question you may ask is: Why? And another question is: Whom should I trust? The legendary data scientist David Robinson or the author of this book? In Chapter 6, we will have a more detailed discussion about the pros and cons of using dictionary-based methods. Regarding the question of “whom should you trust?”, our approach has face validity and criterion validity. For face validity, We have used a dictionary designed for studying social media data (AFINN), whereas David Robinson used NRC dictionaries which are not designed for studying social media data. For criterion validity, we have validated our AFINN scores with some human-categorized tweets. We have evidence that our AFINN scores correlate well with human judgements of sentiment. David Robinson had no such information. There are some information which is important. Dictionary-based methods are very sensitive to content length. One thing you need to know is that Trump’s tweets from an android are in general shorter than tweets from an iPhone. Also, these tweets are in general more positive. tibble(afinn = all_afinn_score, android = trump_tweets_target$android, text = trump_tweets_target$text, ntokens = ntoken(text, remove_punct = TRUE)) %&gt;% group_by(android) %&gt;% summarise(mean_ntokens = mean(ntokens), mean_afinn = mean(afinn)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## android mean_ntokens mean_afinn ## &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 FALSE 24.6 0.0786 ## 2 TRUE 17.9 0.0962 We can demonstrate it using a scatterplot. tibble(afinn = all_afinn_score, android = trump_tweets_target$android, text = trump_tweets_target$text, ntokens = ntoken(text, remove_punct = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = afinn, x = ntokens, col = android)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;) In Chapter 6, I will demonstrate further why we always need to check for the influence of content length. In our AFINN score calculation, we have adjusted for the effect of content length. However, our AFINN score is still correlated with content length with a correlation coefficient of -0.2. Unfortunately, David Robinson did not control for the influence of content length. Therefore, we don’t know whether his finding is indicating the actual sentiment, the residual effect of content length or a murky mixture of the two. OK, enough. This is not a diss track. Let’s go to the summary of this chapter, shall we? 3.6 Zusammenfassung In this chapter, I have used a “whole game” to demonstrate the differences between automated content analysis and other approaches. It can be summarized into a few bullet points: Automated content analysis always starts with research questions or hypotheses. Automated content analysis is a content analysis, therefore, we need to demonstrate the validity and reliability of our measurement. Automated content analysis is usually a cost-cutting measure because manual content analysis is very expensive when the n is getting larger. We can extract semantics from a piece of text using automated methods. But we must bear in mind that these extracted semantics are surrogate —Not always true—. Because we have the bullet point 2 above, we need to show that the surrogate measure is a good approximation of human judgement. There are many problems associated with automated extraction of semantics from a piece of text. I hope this chapter is a eye-opener for you and you want to dig deeper into the world of automated content analysis. In the next chapter, we are going to define (automated) content analysis and establish some best practices. References "],
